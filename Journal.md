Figure out how to create a more dynamic version for wagering
(would likly nessitate removing diffrence between HS/LS or triggering a switch at 200cu)
Find out how add randomint funcs together
Figure out how to pass bet into W/L func
W/L func needs to be able to see output of random int func
Order of funcs(? have to check)
.input H/L stakes(may not do in favor of dynamic)
.input Money amount
.random intgen for each button
.stop rig funcs after hitting num >16(probably don't need to do this)
.output W/L conditions
.use W/L Cons to calc money
.change money amount
.play agian Y/N?-take winnings or continue playing?
pass rig funcs as var?

-css
Have to figure out how render a background/effects for win-loose
